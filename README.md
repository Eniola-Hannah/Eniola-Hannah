### 🙋🏽‍♀️ About Me  
**𝕴’𝖒 𝖓𝖔𝖙 𝖏𝖚𝖘𝖙 𝖆 𝕯𝖆𝖙𝖆 𝕾𝖈𝖎𝖊𝖓𝖙𝖎𝖘𝖙 — 𝕴’𝖒 𝖆 𝖋𝖔𝖗𝖈𝖊 𝖔𝖋 𝖕𝖚𝖗𝖕𝖔𝖘𝖊 𝖆𝖓𝖉 𝖕𝖗𝖊𝖘𝖊𝖓𝖈𝖊.**

Beyond analyzing datasets, building dashboards and developing models, I’m deeply driven by impact — especially through **Speaking Engagements**, Teaching, and Leading teams. I’ve had the privilege of speaking in various settings, tutoring students, hosting events, and leading academic groups within my institution.

My leadership journey began early as the firstborn in my family, but I’ve since cultivated it intentionally — both through hands-on experience and continuous learning through books & other means.

Outside of work, I value rest, reflection, and faith. I enjoy reading, watching movies, and spending quiet time with God(Ohh I love the Lord!).

**𝐈 𝐀𝐌 𝐄𝐍𝐈𝐎𝐋𝐀 𝐇𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐀𝐇** — passionate, purpose-driven, and building something that matters. 🤍💙
